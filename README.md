vagrant-elasticsearch-cluster
=============================

Heavily inspired by [https://github.com/ypereirareis/vagrant-elasticsearch-cluster](https://github.com/ypereirareis/vagrant-elasticsearch-cluster) - With great thanks! I needed a 2.x version.

Create an ElasticSearch cluster with a single bash command :

```
vagrant up
```

**Programs, plugins, libs and versions information**

1.Installation and requirements
--

**Must have on your local machine**

* VirtualBox (last version)
* Vagrant (>=1.5)
* cUrl (or another REST client to talk to ES)

**Clone this repository**

git clone git@github.com:fracklen/vagrant-elasticsearch-cluster.git

**WARNING**

You'll need enough RAM to run VMs in your cluster.
Each new VM launched within your cluster will have 1GB of RAM allocated.
You can change this configuration in the Vagrantfile once cloned.

2.How to run a new ElasticSearch cluster
--

**Important**

The maximum number VMs running in the cluster is 5.
Indeed, it is possible to run much more than 5, but it's not really needed for a test environment cluster,
and the RAM needed would be much more important.
If you still want to use more than 5 VMs,
you will have to add/edit your own configuration files in the [conf](conf) directory.

**Run the cluster**

Simply go in the cloned directory (vagrant-elasticsearch-cluster by default).
Execute this command :

```
vagrant up
```

By default, this command will boot 5 VMs, with `vagrant-es-cluster` name, `1GB` of RAM for each node and this network ip address `192.168.99.{11-15}`.

3.Vagrant
--

You can use every vagrant command to manage your cluster and VMs.
This project is simply made to launch a working ES cluster with a single command, using vagrant/virtualbox virtual machines.

Use it to test every configuration/queries you want (split brain, unicast, recovery, indexing, sharding)

4.Important
--

Do forks, PR, and MRs !!!!
